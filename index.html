<p>Donald Duck, an ill-tempered, squawking <strong>cartoon duck</strong> who was Walt Disney’s second most famous cartoon character after Mickey Mouse and who enjoyed worldwide popularity as the star of animated films, newspaper comic strips, comic books, and television. Donald Duck’s first film appearance was in a supporting role in <em>The Wise Little Hen (1934)</em>, which was an episode of Walt Disney’s Silly Symphonies series of cartoon shorts. 

Donald wears the middy blouse of a sailor suit and a sailor’s hat, at the drop of which he often explodes into a rage. He has so little tolerance for frustration that he would shoot an annoying insect with a shotgun rather than pursue it patiently with a flyswatter. In the late 1930s Donald was joined by his perennial girlfriend, Daisy Duck, and by his three mischievous nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Duck">[Read more...]</a></p>

		<h3>Paperinik</h3>
		<p>Paperinik is Donald Duck's superhero alterego. Donald originally created his superheroic identity as a means of secretly seeking revenge against relatives such as Scrooge McDuck and Gladstone Gander, but soon found himself fighting other menaces. The character is an Italian invention and, though dominant in stories in which he appears, is very much absent from all others not starring him.</p>

			<h3>Kingdom Hearts</h3>
			<p>Donald Duck also features the videogame series <strong>Kingdom Hearts</strong>. In Kingdom Hearts, Donald is the Royal Magician of Disney Castle and the royal assistant for King Mickey. As such, his weapon of choice is a Staff. He often provides comic relief more than advancing the plot despite the amount of camera time he has in the series. He is rash and has an aggressive personality, but he is loyal to his friends.</p>
